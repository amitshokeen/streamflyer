#### Transition from Google Code to GitHub

The project is moved from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/streamflyer/) to GitHub recently (2015-03-24).
The transition of the documentation is not complete yet. The content of the wiki is already moved: 
[Home](https://github.com/rwitzel/streamflyer/blob/wiki/ProjectHome.md)
([page list](https://github.com/rwitzel/streamflyer/tree/wiki))

Attention! The most recent version is built with *Java 8*.

The groupId of the artifacts has been changed: 

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.rwitzel.streamflyer</groupId>
        <artifactId>streamflyer-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.0</version>
    </dependency>

The package names have been changed to avoid classpath issues.
